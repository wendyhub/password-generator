# Unit 03 JavaScript Homework: Password Generator


## Decription

This project was created to solve the security issues of weak passwords. Given that a user needs a new, secured password, they will be promted to determine certain character types required for the password and then a new random password will be generated.

The new password implements greater security to sensitive data and saves time for users.

The criteria that the password is able to meet are:
*the password is between 8 - 128 characters long AND
*the password must have at least one of the following character types:
    *lowercase characters
    *uppercasse characters
    *special characters
    *numeric characters


## Creator's notes

I found this assignment quite challenging. I had the concept/pseudo code in mind of what I wanted to achieve but ultimately there were flaws in my code. Particularly, I found it difficult to create a formula to generate the random code. Nonetheless I learned a lot while working on this project and hope to get the password generator to a working state as I will continue to debug/re-write the code.
