# Unit 03 JavaScript Homework: Password Generator


## Decription

This project was created to solve the security issues of weak passwords. Given that a user needs a new, secured password, they will be promted to determine certain character types required for the password and then a new random password will be generated.

The new password implements greater security to sensitive data and saves time for users.

The criteria that the password is able to meet are:
<br>
1) the password is between 8 - 128 characters long, AND
<br>
2) the password must have at least one of the following character types:
    *lowercase characters <br>
    *uppercasse characters <br>
    *special characters <br>
    *numeric characters <br>


## Creator's notes

I found this assignment quite challenging. I had the concept/pseudo code in mind of what I wanted to achieve but there were flaws in my code along the way. I particularly found it difficult to create a formula to generate the random code. Nonetheless I learned a lot while working on this project and hope to get the password generator to a better state as I will continue to debug the code.
